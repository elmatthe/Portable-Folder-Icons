# Portable Folder Icons — Handoff

## Current Focus

All implementation phases and the bug hunt are complete on
`feature/v0.1.0-portable-folder-icons`. The Step 1 launcher defect reported
during manual acceptance testing is fixed and verified automatically; waiting
for the user to rerun Step 1, complete the remaining Explorer acceptance
tests, and explicitly approve the merge.

## Open Issues / Bugs

| # | Severity | File | Description | Status | Found by |
|---|----------|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Critical | `Setup_and_Run-Portable-Folder-Icons.bat` | Passing the trailing-backslash checkout root as `"%~dp0"` caused native PowerShell argument parsing to retain a closing quote in the value sent to `GetFullPath`. | Fixed / awaiting user Step 1 retest | User |
| 2 | Minor | Explorer UI | Windows may retain a stale folder image until navigating away/back despite targeted notification; documented and pending manual characterization. | Documented / manual QA | Codex |
| 3 | Suggestion | Selection | Multi-folder apply needs safe multi-path transport and partial-failure UX. | Deferred beyond v0.1.0 per plan | User / Codex |

## Work Log (newest first)

- 2026-07-28 — Diagnosed the manual Step 1 failure at the native
  batch-to-PowerShell boundary. `%~dp0` ends in `\`; enclosing that value
  directly in quotes caused the closing quote to reach PowerShell as a literal
  U+0022. The malformed installer argument was
  `C:\Users\ematthew\Portable-User-Installs\Portable-Folder-Icons<QUOTE>`.
  Changed the launcher boundary to `"%~dp0."`, which preserves spaces and
  Unicode while allowing `GetFullPath` to canonicalize the harmless final
  component. Regression tests cover the actual checkout, spaces, Unicode, the
  exact malformed value, and launcher argument construction. All 79 assertions
  pass. Full setup succeeded from both the actual checkout and a temporary
  spaces-plus-Unicode checkout; a controlled pre-install failure preserved the
  active runtime and manifest byte-for-byte. Manual Step 1 remains failed until
  the user reruns and accepts it. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Recorded the user-corrected case-only icon directory rename as
  `files/ICO-Files` in Git and updated runtime code, tests, config, permanent
  docs, and the retained plan. Full Windows PowerShell 5.1 verification passes
  with 73 assertions, ten ICO validations, and an exact-case directory gate.
  — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 6 systematic bug hunt completed across every shipped
  batch/PowerShell script. Fixed unsafe batch dynamic-path echoing, adjacent
  empty INI-section cleanup, duplicate shell-section ambiguity, cache-conflict
  activation, and whole-operation Apply/Reset recovery; added regression
  assertions for each. The ignored manual checklist is at
  `files/test-logs/v0.1.0_pre-release.md`. Final gate: 73 assertions plus all
  structural/security/documentation checks pass under Windows PowerShell 5.1.
  No unresolved critical issue; user-only Explorer tests remain. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 5 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1. Added
  installed runtime/cache integrity Repair, exact-scope confirmed Uninstall,
  default cache preservation, separately warned purge, post-exit cleanup,
  staged-update rollback, comprehensive README/config/permanent docs, and
  final gates for root layout, forbidden code, metadata, docs, parsing, all
  ICOs, tests, PowerShell version, and `git diff --check`. 69 assertions and
  the complete verify gate pass. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 4 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1. Added
  protected/root/filesystem target checks, manifest/hash-resolved Apply,
  cached-icon integrity verification, recoverable UTF-16LE `desktop.ini`
  writes, selective icon-field Reset, narrow attribute operations,
  `SHChangeNotify`, and refresh of only Explorer windows showing the affected
  parent. Temp-folder tests cover unrelated-content preservation, encoding,
  attributes, idempotence, empty-INI deletion, malformed INI recovery, and
  corrupt cache rejection. 60 assertions pass; `git diff --check` is clean.
  — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 3 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1. Added
  the documented HKCU `ExtendedSubCommandsKey\shell` cascade, alphabetic
  hash-derived icon verbs, separator flag, Reset/Repair/Uninstall commands,
  `MultiSelectModel=Single`, fixed `-File` action commands, strict tool-owned
  registry guards, and setup registration after runtime/manifest validation.
  A complete disposable-root dry-run plan and special-character LocalAppData
  path are covered; 44 assertions pass and `git diff --check` is clean.
  — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 2 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1. Replaced
  the generic Python launcher with a non-admin inbox-PowerShell launcher and
  added staged runtime installation, immediate ICO rescan, hash-cache
  copy/reuse, manifest validation/write, results table, totals, and installed
  paths. The automated installer ran twice under a path containing spaces and
  Unicode: first run copied all ten ICOs; second run reused all ten and
  preserved the cache. 34 assertions pass and `git diff --check` is clean.
  — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 1 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1. Added
  side-effect-free core behavior and 30 deterministic assertions covering
  normalization, empty labels, valid/malformed/unreadable/zero-byte ICOs,
  SHA-256 cache copy/reuse, duplicate labels, manifest round trips/corruption,
  filesystem/registry guards, single-selection paths with Unicode, and
  preserving unrelated `desktop.ini` content during apply/reset.
  `git diff --check` is clean. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 0 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1:
  permanent files were de-templated, the preliminary pure-PowerShell verify
  gate passed all required-file, parse, ICO, and changelog checks, and
  `git diff --check` was clean. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 0 audit complete: read all instructions and source,
  validated all ten ICOs through .NET, confirmed the GitHub remote was empty,
  created/pushed baseline commit `79e0ee1` on `main`, and created the required
  feature branch. Historical backups and logs remain local and ignored because
  they contain machine-specific paths. — Codex
