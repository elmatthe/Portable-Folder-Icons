## Work Log (newest first)

- 2026-07-28 — Phase 1 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1. Added
  side-effect-free core behavior and 30 deterministic assertions covering
  normalization, empty labels, valid/malformed/unreadable/zero-byte ICOs,
  SHA-256 cache copy/reuse, duplicate labels, manifest round trips/corruption,
  filesystem/registry guards, single-selection paths with Unicode, and
  preserving unrelated `desktop.ini` content during apply/reset.
  `git diff --check` is clean. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 0 checkpoint passed under Windows PowerShell 5.1:
  permanent files were de-templated, the preliminary pure-PowerShell verify
  gate passed all required-file, parse, ICO, and changelog checks, and
  `git diff --check` was clean. — Codex
- 2026-07-28 — Phase 0 audit complete: read all instructions and source,
  validated all ten ICOs through .NET, confirmed the GitHub remote was empty,
  created/pushed baseline commit `79e0ee1` on `main`, and created the required
  feature branch. Historical backups and logs remain local and ignored because
  they contain machine-specific paths. — Codex
